## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are dynamic fields that explore the creation of intelligent systems capable of learning and decision-making. This repository aims to provide a platform for learning, collaboration, and exploration in these fascinating domains.

## Branches

### [AI](./AI)

The AI folder contains foundational concepts, algorithms, and applications in Artificial Intelligence. Here are a few highlights:

- **Intelligent Agents:** Understand the principles behind intelligent agents and how they can mimic human cognitive functions.
  
- **Knowledge Representation:** Learn about representing knowledge in AI systems for effective problem-solving.

- **Problem Solving Techniques:** Explore various problem-solving techniques employed in AI, such as search algorithms and heuristic methods.

### [ML](./ML)

The ML folder delves into the diverse world of Machine Learning, where algorithms learn patterns from data. Key topics include:

- **Supervised Learning:** Understand how models are trained on labeled data for tasks like classification and regression.
  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Explore the realm of unsupervised learning for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learn about training models through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

### [DL](./DL)

The DL folder is dedicated to the cutting-edge field of Deep Learning, focusing on advanced neural network architectures:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Dive into image processing and recognition with CNNs.
  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Understand the power of sequential data processing with RNNs.
  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Explore the fascinating world of generating realistic data using GANs.
